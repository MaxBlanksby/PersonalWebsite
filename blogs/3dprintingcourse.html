      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        I enrolled in the 3D printing course during the fall semester of 2025, driven by a fascination with how additive manufacturing is transforming prototyping and production. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with various 3D printing technologies and understand their applications in design and engineering. I expected to learn both the technical skills and the creative problem-solving aspects of 3D printing.

      <h2>Course Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The course was structured around weekly lectures, hands-on lab sessions, and project work. We worked with several types of 3D printers including FDM and SLA machines, learning their operational differences and ideal use cases. The curriculum covered 3D modeling, slicing, printer maintenance, and post-processing techniques, providing a comprehensive foundation in additive manufacturing.
      </p>

      <h3>Technologies and Skills Learned:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Proficiency in CAD software such as Fusion 360 and Tinkercad</li>
        <li>Understanding of FDM and SLA 3D printing technologies</li>
        <li>Material properties including PLA, ABS, and resin types</li>
        <li>Use of slicing software like Cura and PreForm</li>
        <li>Post-processing methods including sanding, curing, and painting</li>
        <li>Design principles tailored for additive manufacturing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the course, I designed and printed several projects ranging from simple geometric shapes to functional prototypes like phone stands and mechanical parts. I faced challenges such as optimizing support structures and balancing print speed with quality. Iterative testing and redesign helped me improve my models and printing parameters.

      <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The course presented several technical hurdles including adhesion failures, warping, and layer misalignment. Debugging print errors required understanding machine calibration, environmental factors, and material behaviors. I developed troubleshooting strategies such as adjusting bed leveling, modifying print settings, and experimenting with different materials.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Issues and Solutions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Improving bed adhesion using glue sticks and heated beds</li>
        <li>Addressing layer separation by optimizing print temperature and speed</li>
        <li>Designing effective support structures to minimize material waste</li>
        <li>Mitigating warping through enclosure use and proper cooling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Applications and Future Potential</h2>
      <p>
        I gained insight into the expanding role of 3D printing in industries such as healthcare, aerospace, and custom manufacturing. The technology's potential for rapid prototyping and low-volume production is particularly exciting. I foresee advancements in multi-material printing and bioprinting opening new frontiers.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on My Engineering Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        Learning about 3D printing has broadened my understanding of manufacturing flexibility and design iteration. It has encouraged me to think more critically about material selection and production constraints in my projects. This experience has enhanced my problem-solving skills and inspired me to integrate additive manufacturing into future engineering challenges.

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        The most valuable lessons from the course include the importance of design for manufacturability, patience in troubleshooting, and continuous learning. For beginners, I recommend starting with simple designs and gradually exploring complex geometries. Embracing failure as part of the learning process is essential to mastering 3D printing.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, the 3D printing course was an enriching experience that deepened my technical skills and expanded my creative horizons. It complements my broader interests in engineering and design, equipping me with practical tools to innovate and prototype effectively in my future endeavors.
