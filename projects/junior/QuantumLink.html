      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Currently working on and producing a quantum computing tool called Quantum Link. It is being developed to help quantum circuit designers identify operations that can be executed in parallel, with the goal of enhancing computation speed and efficiency in their work.
        it works by looking through a quantum circuit finding operations that do not share qubits and grouping them together to be ran at the same time.
        it works by using a partied graph creating nodes for each operation and edge rules that make opperations that can be ran in parrelell not connent to the other parts of the graph shocasing there indepencedce. it is currently in progress.
        here is the github link to track the progess of the code <a href="https://github.com/MaxBlanksby/QuantumLink">here</a>.
