      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Quantum Link is a quantum computing optimization tool designed to identify and enable parallel execution within quantum circuits. It represents a circuit as a directed graph, where nodes correspond to quantum operations and edges encode qubit dependencies and execution constraints. By constructing this graph, Quantum Link runs computations over its structure to detect independent operations that do not share qubits, allowing them to be scheduled and executed in parallel. This approach improves circuit efficiency by reducing overall depth and optimizing execution order. The project is currently under active development, with ongoing work focused on refining graph rules and optimization strategies. You can follow progress on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/MaxBlanksby/QuantumLink">here</a>.
