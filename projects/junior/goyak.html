      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        As the leader of the Engineering Club, I'm spearheading the Goyak project—an innovative go-kart build that creatively repurposes a kayak as the frame and seat. This unique design involves fabricating a custom metal frame to securely mount the kayak, then integrating a powerful 3000-watt motor powered by six 12-volt lead acid batteries to create a high-performance go-kart. The vehicle features disc brakes for reliable stopping power, an ignition switch for controlled startup, and a speed panel to monitor real-time velocity. Leading this initiative has given me hands-on experience in project management, team coordination, and mechanical engineering. The project challenges us to design a robust chassis, wire the electrical system for optimal power delivery, integrate the braking and instrumentation systems, and ensure structural integrity throughout. It's a rewarding experience that brings together students from various engineering disciplines to collaborate on building something truly unique and fun.
