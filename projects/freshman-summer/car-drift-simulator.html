      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Created a car simulator that runs on a Godot engine, controlled by a Raspberry Pi with a 3D-printed steering wheel and accelerometer.
        The Pi hosts a socket server that streams wheel-angle data to a PC, which reads those angles to steer a custom-built game—complete with left/right click–activated drifting.
        this program was created at a summer camp in Stanford called Id Tech where we got two weeks to create a project of our choice.
