      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project was created during an immersive two‑week summer program at the end of the Catlin Gabel school year. It is a browser‑based Pong remake where the paddle is controlled entirely with your hand through MediaPipe hand tracking. Moving your hand upward raises the paddle, and moving it downward lowers it, creating a natural and intuitive control style without the need for a keyboard.

        The project also includes a standalone hand‑tracking backend designed for future gesture‑based applications. During testing after creation, we noticed that players positioned far apart like across states or countries experienced tracking or latency difficulties, this was not fully tested in production since most development and gameplay occurred while working side‑by‑side keep this noted when playing.

        Try playing with your friends by visiting <a href="https://cs.catlin.edu/pages/2025/max/">here</a>. If you're curious about the implementation details, the full code is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/MaxBlanksby/GestureBasedPong">here</a>.
