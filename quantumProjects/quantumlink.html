      <h2>About This Program</h2>
      <p>
        For my final project at The Knowledge Society (TKS), I created Quantum Link, a moonshot idea aimed at enabling quantum computers to communicate and share entangled states. The goal of Quantum Link was to allow multiple quantum computers to link together by distributing entanglement, so they could collaboratively run larger algorithms that a single quantum computer couldn’t handle on its own. With my team, we researched existing quantum networking technologies, proposed innovative protocols for entanglement distribution, and outlined a roadmap for practical implementation. This project deepened my passion for quantum computing and showed me how big ideas, grounded in science, can lead to breakthroughs that change the world.
